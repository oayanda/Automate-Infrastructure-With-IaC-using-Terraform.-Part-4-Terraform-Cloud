# PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

In this articule, we will be puting it all together from part one. I will also introduce what Terraform calls Remote Operations. Simply put, Remote Operations are terraform runs managed by Terraform Cloud.

1. **Create a Terraform Cloud account**

For this project we will use a free account. Register an Terraform account [here](https://app.terraform.io/signup/account)

3. **Configure a workspace**

4. **Configure variables**

5. **Run Terrafrom scripts with Packer**

6. **Run terraform plan and terraform apply from web console**

7. **Test automated terraform plan**
