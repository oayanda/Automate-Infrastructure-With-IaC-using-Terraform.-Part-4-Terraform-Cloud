In this articule, we will be puting it all together from part one. I will also introduce what Terraform calls Remote Operations. Simply put, Remote Operations are terraform runs managed by Terraform Cloud.

1. Create a Terraform Cloud account
2. Create an organization
3. Configure a workspace
4. Configure variables
5. Run Terrafrom scripts with Packer
6. Run terraform plan and terraform apply from web console
7. Test automated terraform plan
